Dragon Hero Archetypes!
Dragons can grow in strength by taking Dragon Hero Archetypes, racial archetypes for classes that improve their dragon abilities in exchange. 
Levels in all Dragon Hero archetypes stack forr progressing their dragon abilities, so 3 levels in Sacred Warder and 2 in Trueblood Sorcerer will quality for 5th level Dragon Hero abilities.
At first level, Dragon Heros gain a Dragon Essence, giving them elemental resistance 5 to the element tied with their dragon type. At 5th, 10th, and 15th level, this resistance improves to 10, 20, and 30 respectively.
At fifth level, Dragon Heros gain Powerful Spellcasting, improving their spell penetration by 1, and a further +1 at 10th, 15th, and 20th level.
At fifth level, Dragon Heros gain the Dracomorphosis feature, improving their true forms abilities. At 5th level, the dragon grows to medium, at 10th, large, and at 15th huge. 20th level in source material grows to gargantuan, but may need to be adapted differently for Wrath of the Righteous.

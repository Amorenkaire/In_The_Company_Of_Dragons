# In The Company of Dragons #
Did you ever play 'Dungeons & Dragons' and wish you could play a dragon, and wanted to have that experience in Wrath of the Righteous? Were you excited at the idea of getting to play a Gold Dragon, only to discover the Mythic Path wasn't avaliable until the end of the game? Then this mod is for you!

Based off of the Taninim from the third party book 'In The Company of Dragons' by Rite Publishing, reflavored to be True Dragons. You start as a small-sized dragon without much power (a bite, two claws, and a +2 Natural Armor bonus), but gain power and size as you take levels in a Dragon Hero archetype that scales across all classes with their respective archetype. Some Archetypes also have additional features on top of receiving the Dragon Hero progression.

## Installation ##
1. Install Unity Mod Manager (UMM).
2. Download the latest release of In The Company of Dragons.
3. Use UMM to install the mod.

## Recommended Mods ##
Toybox. Some features are incomplete and require Toybox to bridge the gap (model sizes and known spells).
Expanded Content. Adds additional dragon features that may be useful for your playthrough, such as adding the dragon deities.

## Known Issues 
* You'll be referenced as a half-elf in dialogue and events.
* Dragon model starts at medium size despite starting at small, and dragon model stays at huge despite assuming gargantuan size at level 20. Please use Toybox to adjust visual model if you desire (or don't for the big boy dragon, if you think he's fat enough!)
* Your hands are not disabled, allowing weapons to be used. This disables the claw attack for that slot, but no animation will play for your weapon attacks.
* Resting in Dragon form __might__ cause issues. At least I occasionally had a bug that may be related where the sleep events became permanently bugged out afterwards (any crafted items/cooked food will display as unlocalized string text). Turning off Alternate Form and assuming human form seems to fix it, so be aware.
* Natural Sorcery only works (I think) if Trueblood Sorcerer levels are taken first.
* Natural Sorcery doesn't grant you the spells known you'd gain from the acquired Sorcerer casting levels. Please consult the Spells Known table and use Toybox to acquire the spells you're entitled to for now.
